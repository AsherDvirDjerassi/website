    <p>I am a <a href="https://lsa.umich.edu/soc/people/current-graduate-students/asher-dvir-djerassi.html">Ph.D. candidate in Sociology and Public Policy at the University of Michigan</a></li>.  As part of my dissertation work, I serve as a <a href="https://www.inequalitydynamics.umich.edu/about/">Fellow at the Stone Center for Inequality Dynamics</a></li> and as a core member of the <a href="https://www.inequalitydynamics.umich.edu/project/wam/">Wealth and Mobility (WAM) Study</a></li>. As a Trainee at the University of Michigan's Population Studies Center, I have been funded by the National Institutes of Health. I came to the University of Michigan with an M.S. in data science from the City University of New York, a B.A. in economics from Hampshire College, and a year of graduate coursework in economics from Sciences Poâ€“Paris. From 2014 to 2015, I served as a Fulbright in Bulgaria. My research primarily concerns income and wealth inequality; it is situated within the fields of fiscal sociology, stratification, historical institutionalism, and political economy. My dissertation examines the role of pensions in the development of American wealth stratification.
